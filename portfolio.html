                <br>Course: Design Fundamental; Spring 2023; Ink on paper.
                <br>The 7x7 Pattern Design is one of the projects in Design Fundamentals. The class had to make each of their own unique patterns with lines and shapes. They will design one segment of their pattern and xerox the piece to have four pieces in total. After xeroxing four pieces, they will need to mix and match to find a new pattern from their original one. After they are satisfied with the final pattern look, they will print out four copies of the new pattern and make one large final pattern that is seven by seven inches.</p>

                <br>The 9 squares is one of the projects in Design Fundamentals. Students have to cut out abstract shapes from different magazines. They will paste these cut out pieces to the white foam board. Then, they will need to relate and connect these abstract pieces in terms of focal point, utility, color, balance, contrast, texture, flow, and negative space. The goal of this project was to make different abstract images look like one cohesive abstract piece.</p>

                <br>The class collectively chose a theme, and each student will be assigned a piece to work with. The end piece should look different but fits well together regardless. Students are only allowed to use pencils to shade and draw. They will use different shading, patterns, lines, and shapes to make their assigned piece as interesting as possible while making sure their piece will still fit well with the rest.</p>

                <br>The Architectural Pattern is one of the projects in Design Fundamentals. Students took pictures of campus architecture and edited them to look like abstract patterns in photoshop. Then, they will need to trace these shapes on illustrator. After they are done tracing, they will apply color to their architectural patterns. They have a limited color palette of three colors with three variations. After applying the colors, they will flip the canvas horizontally then vertically. They will continue flipping the canvas until they cover the whole canvas.</p>

                <br>For the Interpretation project, students will need to choose a work of art that they are not familiar with, then they will need to interpret and recreate this work of art in their own style. Students need to decide what part they want to keep and what part they wish to change. In this case, the artist chose to keep the color and general lines and shape of the original art piece. Then, she drew the rest of the art work with a drawing style she is familiar with.</p>

                <br>For the Triptych project, students had to take 3 different angled pictures of one object. Then, they will scale, rotate, and distort the image so that the 3 different pictures would form into one single coherent image. The goal is to create an entirely new image out of ordinary mundane objects. After students are done with editing their image, they will print out and spray mount it on a white foam board. For the final touch, they will cut off excessive white space to make the image fill the white foam board entirely.</p>
